# Model Recipes

SGL Model Recipes is a community-maintained hub of reference setups that make deploying and operating SGL fast, consistent, and reproducible. Inside youâ€™ll find curated configurations, scripts, and best-practice guides covering a range of models, hardware targets, and deployment environments. 
Each recipe is designed to be copy-paste friendly, benchmarkable, and easy to adapt to your needs. 
Contributions are welcome: submit new recipes, improvements, or bug fixes via PRs, and open issues for requests
