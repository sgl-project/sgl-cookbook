A community-maintained repository of practical guides and recipes for deploying and using SGLang in production environments. Our mission is simple: answer the question **"How do I use SGLang (and related models) on hardware Y for task Z?"** with clear, actionable solutions.

## 🎯 What You'll Find Here

This cookbook aggregates battle-tested SGLang recipes covering:

- **Models**: Mainstream LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
- **Use Cases**: Inference serving, deployment strategies, multimodal applications
- **Hardware**: GPU and CPU configurations, optimization for different accelerators
- **Best Practices**: Configuration templates, performance tuning, troubleshooting guides

Each recipe provides step-by-step instructions to help you quickly implement SGLang solutions for your specific requirements.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Browse the recipe index above to find your model
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in each guide
3. Adapt configurations to your specific hardware and requirements
4. Join our community to share feedback and improvements

## 🤝 Contributing
